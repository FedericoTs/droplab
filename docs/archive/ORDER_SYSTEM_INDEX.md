## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why 4 weeks? Can we go faster?**
A: We could ship a basic version in 2 weeks, but 4 weeks allows for proper testing, error handling, and polish. Cutting corners would increase risk.

**Q: What if the PDF generation fails?**
A: We have a CSV export fallback. User can still get their data in spreadsheet format.

**Q: Can this scale to 10,000 stores?**
A: Yes. The architecture is designed for infinite scalability. PDF generation is the bottleneck (~1 sec per 100 stores).

**Q: What about supplier integration?**
A: Phase 1 uses email. Phase 2 can add API integration if supplier provides one.

**Q: Is AI Orchestrator (Phase 2) risky?**
A: Not with proper safeguards. We start conservative (90% confidence threshold), always include human review, and can revert to manual if needed.

**Q: What if users don't trust the AI?**
A: They can override any recommendation. The system is AI-assisted, not AI-controlled. User always has final say.

**Q: How do we measure success?**
A: Time saved (target: 97%), error rate (target: 0%), user satisfaction (target: >4.5/5), ROI (target: $30k+/year).
